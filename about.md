##**Project Overview**

The aim of our project is to implement a bottom-up implementation of Google Street View for the insides of Olin buildings. We have split our goals into specific components:

* Research Hector SLAM and write Python implementations of some major components
* Integrate our code into the existing framework and use the Neato robots to map out an area of Olin
* Learn about and write an image-stitching algorithm to create panoramas of specified waypoints in the map
* Develop a web interface for users to view the map and related panoramas at each waypoint
